## Notes

This was a great introduction to learning how to create Apps for Android, and overall went smoothly! 
There were some hiccups when first downloading and installing Android Studio, and in particular, getting the simulator to load up and work. A few iterations of installing the recommendations from Android Studio solved this.
Once this was up and running other than some issues with calling "itemsAdapter" before initialization (which was solved by essentially starting fresh on that piece of code) things went well.
I hope to extend the functionality and improve the design of this app in the near future!
